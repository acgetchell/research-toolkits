There are many programming languages used in Data Science, including but not limited to:

# High-level Languages

* [R](http://www.r-project.org/) – a free programming language and software environment for statistical computing. It provides a variety of statistical and graphical techniques and is highly extensible. R is popular across research domains for developing statistical software and data analyses, and producing publication quality graphics.
* [Python](http://www.python.org/) – a free, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes efficiency and code readability. It is object-oriented and often used for web and app development.
* [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) – computing environment and proprietary programming language used most commonly in engineering, physics and economics.
* [Julia](http://julialang.org/) – free dynamic programming language for numerical analysis and computing.
* [Scala](http://docs.scala-lang.org/) – genera-purpose language combining object-oriented and functional programming. It runs on the Java platform provides language interoperability with Java.
* [SAS](http://www.sas.com/) – “Statistical Analysis System,” a proprietary software suite for data analytics. It is used by researchers in many domains to munge, mine and analyze data from a variety of sources. It is particularly popular in the health sciences.

# Low-level Languages

* [C++](https://isocpp.org/)
* [C](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/)
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html)
* FORTRAN

# Use-specific Languages

* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) – primarily used in visualization, dashboards, and mashups for webpages.
* UNIX shell – interactive command language and a scripting language for controlling the executions of the operating system.
* Regular Expressions – sequence of symbols and characters used to search for a string or pattern within a text.
* SQL – Structured Query Language is used to communicate with a database and is the standard for many relational database management systems.
* [Pig](https://pig.apache.org/) – used with Apache Hadoop for complex data transformations.
* XPath – XML Path Language is a syntax for defining parts of an XML document.
