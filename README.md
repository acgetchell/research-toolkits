# UC Davis DataLab Research Toolkits

This repository hosts the pages used for research toolkits on various subjects. Anyone is welcome to contribute to the toolkits. To update a toolkit page, make the appropriate changes in the `pages/` R markdown file the corresponds to the page, or create your own! When you think your changes are ready, please make a pull request. Once your request has been approved, this repository will automatically knit your markdown into a webpage.

When you link to an external page in a toolkit, please add `{rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}` after the link, e.g. `[Link text](https://link.address.com){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}`. This will make it so the links open in a new window, rather than in the toolkit iframe on the DataLab website. If you can think of a way to automate that, please see issue #1.
